/*!
 * This file defines the interface to the main set of algorithms for the
 * StackBase model.  More general functionality that involves manipulating
 * the Stack model is placed here.  There is a derived controller called
 * BioStackController that implements more specialized operations in
 * addition to the ones provided here.  For now, functionality such as
 * agglomeration algorithms (found in BioPriors/StackAgglomAlgs.h) is
 * implemented as separate standalone functions rather than being wrapped
 * into this class.  This was done to logically separate such a specific
 * set of actions into a different file, as well as, reduce the dependencies
 * needed to compile the StackController.
